# 💼 Microsoft Fabric Sales Analysis Pipeline  
**End-to-End Lakehouse Project | Azure-Native | Power BI-Ready**

## 🧠 Overview  
This project is a hands-on demonstration of how Microsoft Fabric can be used to architect a modern data pipeline from ingestion to insight — all within the Azure ecosystem.  

Using the **Lakehouse** model, I built a unified environment to load, transform, query, and analyze sales data using both **Visual Dataflows** and **SQL** inside Microsoft Fabric. The project showcases how a Data Engineer can prepare enterprise-grade, analysis-ready datasets — without needing to leave the Fabric environment.

## 🔧 Tools & Services Used
| Service                | Role                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Microsoft Fabric       | Unified platform for ingestion, lakehouse, querying, and BI         |
| OneLake                | Storage layer for tables and files                                   |
| Lakehouse (Warehouse)  | Semantic + SQL querying layer (connected to Power BI)                |
| SQL Query Editor       | For modeling revenue KPIs from raw sales data                        |
| Visual Dataflow Gen2   | No-code/low-code transformations and grouping                        |
| Power BI (Preview)     | Future stage for dashboard development and publishing                |

## 📈 Project Pipeline Flow
1. **📂 Data Ingestion into Lakehouse**  
2. **🔎 SQL-Based KPI Calculation**  
3. **🧩 Visual Transformation with Dataflow Gen2**  
4. **📊 Data Ready for BI & Insights**  

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Fabric-native transformation workflows simplify development by consolidating multiple services into one interface.
- Lakehouse SQL endpoints provide familiar querying power while maintaining scalable storage architecture.
- Visual query building makes quick exploration and prototyping intuitive — especially for operational analytics.
